* Auto Keyword: Let the compiler guess the type
auto x = 5.5; // x is automatically a 'double'

* Ternary Operator: One-line If/Else
int age = 20;
string status = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";

* Structs: Grouping different data types together
struct User {
    int id;
    string name;
};

* Constant Pointers: Prevent data from being changed
const int* p = &age; 
// Meaning: You can see the value, but you can't change it through 'p'
